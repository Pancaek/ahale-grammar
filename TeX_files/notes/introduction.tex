\section{Document structure}
\subsection{Prose}
All prose within the main block of text is self-contained, such that reading it on its own is sufficient to a gain basic understanding of the material.
Other details which accompany the main text support and expand its content from several different prespectives.
The additional materials are designed this way not to discourage deeper reading, but rather to keep the most important details easily accessible without sacrificing depth of coverage for nuanced topics.
