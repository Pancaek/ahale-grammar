Diphthongs are permitted, provided the vowels differ in height.
Under this rule, the diphthongs /iu/ and /ui/ are disallowed.
The similar sequences /iʔu/ and /uʔi/, however, are permitted.

\section{Stress}
\subsection{Timing}
\langname\ is considered syllable-timed, wherein all syllables are pronounced for approximately the same length of time.

\subsection{Placement}
Stress is typically placed on the first syllable in a word.
The only exception is when a word begins with /ə/, in which case it is placed on the second syllable.
Stressed /ə/ is phonologically unstable, which makes it susceptible to shifting elsewhere.
This can be observed in the following hypothetical forms: /ə.pa.lu/ [əˈpalu], and /pa.lu/ [ˈpalu].
Note how both forms are stressed on /pa/, even though the syllable is positioned differently in the word.

Additionally, a small number of morphemes are never able to be stressed, and so stress will shift based on the presence of these morphemes as well.

\subsection{Phonetic Realization}

\section{Allophony} %TODO: Add more to this section

/h/ realized as [ɣ] in stressed syllables

\phonc{h}{ɣ}{\phold V\phonfeat{+stress}}

/ɘ/ is realized as [e] in stressed syllables

\phonc{ə}{e}{\phold\phonfeat{+stress}}

/ɸ/ and /h/ are in free variation before /u/

/au/ monophthongizes to [o] after glottal consonants

\phonc{au}{o}{C\phonfeat{+glottal}\phold}
