Diphthongs consisting of \phomtext{ə} + high vowel can be observed in a few words, however these diphthongs are prone to collapse. In all but the most conservative of dialects, these are realized as \phomtext{əi əu} \phontext{e o}.

\section{Stress}
\subsection{Assignment}
Stress is generally assigned to the initial syllable of a root. However, \phomtext{ə} generally will not recieve stress at this stage and move to the second syllable (even if this is also a schwa).

A subset of affixes (including, but not limited to those which utilize reduplication) are considered ``weak'', in that, like schwa, they repel stress.

Such morphemes will be marked with a comma in morphemic transcription, rather than the usual period used at syllable boundaries. Thus \morphtext{ʔə,} refers to a morpheme \phomtext{ʔə} which repels stress.
