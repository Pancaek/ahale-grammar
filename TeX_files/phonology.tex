\section{Stress}
\subsection{Assignment}
Stress is generally assigned to the initial syllable of a root. However, \phomtext{ə} generally will not recieve stress at this stage and move to the second syllable (even if this is also a schwa).

A subset of affixes (including, but not limited to those which utilize reduplication) are considered ``weak'', in that, like schwa, they repel stress.

Such morphemes will be marked with a comma in morphemic transcription, rather than the usual period used at syllable boundaries. Thus \morphtext{ʔə,} refers to a morpheme \phomtext{ʔə} which repels stress.

\subsection{Realization}

\section{Allophony}
Stressed \phomtext{ə} becomes \phontext{e}

% Consecutive syllables containing the same consonant undergo voicing disimilation such that the first is voiced. Nasals are not affected by this process as they are already voiced.

% \phon{C\textsubscript{1}VC\textsubscript{1}V}{C\textsubscript{1}VC\textsubscript{1}\phonfeat{+voice}V}

% A chain shift then occurred, eliding the voiceless syllable

% \phon{C\textsubscript{1}VC\textsubscript{1}\phonfeat{+voice}V}{C\phonfeat{+voice}V}
