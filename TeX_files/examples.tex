\footnotetext{The original text was: `In an isolated system, entropy can only increase.'}

The translation of `isolated system' is not terribly transparent.
I've taken some liberties with the connotations of the phrase while translating, such that this phrase is less about literal entropy and more about the fragmentation of a group.
Countable nouns are associated with a number in the same fashion adjectives are.
Thus, \langword{mapiʔe ai} refers to a group of only one member, and therefore one which exists in isolation.

The coordinating conjunction \langword{pa} considers the second clause a direct result of the first.
This contrasts with \langword{alete,} which considers the event to have happened due to a culmination of the first among other factors.
In other words, while \langword{alete} creates a much more definitive sense of causation, \langword{pa} functions more aptly when it comes to sequencing.

Because I have reinterpreted this phrase as referring to a group, I have also described the chaos in a particular way.
Namely, considering that the members of the group are assumed to still be alive, it is the place which they meet which is considered to be chaotic.
Alternatively, the people themselves could have been described as having chaos grow within them, but this would have the connotation that the people themselves were driving the group apart rather than some external factor.

\langword{Tamuka} is used for a few reasons.
These sorts of evidentials in some contexts, can play the role of what would be rendered with modal verbs in English.
In this particular instance, \langword{tamuka} also helps cement the idea that this course of action is the only possible one (ie. all others would be therefore be completely unfathomable).
