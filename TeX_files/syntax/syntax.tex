\begingl
\glpreamble ɸumau keke hahawi
\pronounced{ˈɸu.mau ˈke.kə ˈɣa.ha.wi}\endpreamble
Ø-ɸumau[\textsc{abs-}grass]
Ø-keke[\textsc{npst.ipfv-}eat]
ha\textasciitilde hawi[\textsc{erg\textasciitilde}rabbit]
\glft `The grass is being eaten by the rabbit'
\endgl

Because the grass is still the patient of the verb, it is still marked with the ergative. Fronted arguments of transitive verbs become focused. A passive construction will be used in translation to English. This is solely to approximate the topicalization, as this example is not a true passive (the verb's valency is not decreased). Arguments in default position can be focused, albeit in a different manner. Returning to Example \getfullref{alignment.trns}, but with the agent explicitly focused:

\ex
\begingl
\glpreamble hahawi keke lu ɸumau
\pronounced{ˈɣa.ha.wi ˈke.kə ˈlu ˈɸu.mau}\endpreamble
ha\textasciitilde hawi[\textsc{erg\textasciitilde}rabbit]
keke[\textsc{npst.ipfv-}eat]
lu[\textsc{obv}]
ɸumau[\textsc{abs,}grass]
\glft `The rabbit (as opposed to something else) is eating the grass'
\endgl
\xe

By marking the already established patient with the obviative\footnotemark, it puts more focus on the (unmarked) proximal argument than would be typical.

\footnotetext{The standard use of proximate/obviate morphology is falling out of use in favor of case marking, Remaining instances have either become fossilized in expressions and idioms, or fulfilled another grammatical purpose, as seen here.}

\section{Labile Verbs}

A labile verb is a verb that can be either transitive or intransitive, and whose subject when intransitive corresponds to its direct object when transitive. They are also sometimes referred to as ``S=O ambitransitive`` verbs. A prototypical example of this being ``John tripped'' in contrast with ``John tripped Tim''. Unlike a typical ambitransitive verb, the subject's role changes.

\ex
\begingl
\glpreamble ɸihaʔau me
\pronounced{ˈɸi.ha.ʔo ˈme}\endpreamble
ɸihaʔau-∅[trip\textsc{-dir}]
me[\textsc{1sg.abs}]
\glft `You tripped me'
\endgl
\xe

\ex
\begingl
\glpreamble me ɸiahau
\pronounced{ˈme ˈɸi.a.ho}\endpreamble
me[\textsc{1sg.abs}]
ɸiahau-∅[trip-\textsc{-dir}]
\glft `(You) tripped me'
\endgl
\xe

These first two examples utilize concepts which have previously been covered in \Sref{sec:person_hierarchy}. The following utilizes the proximate particle, \langword{ta,} in order to mark \langword{me} as the most agentlike argument of a transitive verb. As such, there is no possibility of inferring an agent of \langword{ɸihaʔau.} In this way, labile verbs can be expressed without the need for a dummy agent.

\ex
\begingl
\glpreamble ta me ɸihaʔau
\pronounced{ˈta ˈme ˈɸi.ha.ʔo}\endpreamble
ta[\textsc{prox}]
me[\textsc{1sg.abs}]
ɸihaʔau-∅[trip\textsc{-dir}]
\glft `I tripped'
\endgl
\xe
